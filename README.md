# brainCloud Godot Examples

This repository contains example Unity projects that make use of the [brainCloud C# client](https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp) â€” an excellent place to start learning how the various [brainCloud APIs](https://getbraincloud.com/) are used!

These projects are meant to be used as code examples and references. Feel free to use our code as an example for your own code.

Note: These projects will not work outside of the box without proper set-up of a brainCloud app.

## Godot Authentication

An example based on the [Unity Authentication example](https://github.com/getbraincloud/examples-unity/tree/master/Authentication) of the same name that demonstrates various brainCloud services. For now, this version demonstrates common functions from the Authentication, Identity, and Entity services, but it will be updated with more brainCloud services soon.
