# Relay Test App

This example demonstrates brainCloud's Matchmaking and Relay services.

It is a simple "game" in which players can view each other's mouse movement and clicks via Relay messages.

It's also cross-platform! Check out the web-based version here: [React RelayTestApp](http://ec2-18-219-26-183.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3004/)
